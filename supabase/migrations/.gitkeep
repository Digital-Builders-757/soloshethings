# Supabase Migrations

This directory contains database migration files.

## Migration Files

Migration files are created using:
```bash
supabase migration new <description>
```

Migration files follow the naming convention:
```
YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_<description>.sql
```

## Important Rules

1. **Never edit existing migrations** - Always create new migration files
2. **Test locally first** - Test migrations before applying to production
3. **Include RLS policies** - All new tables must have RLS enabled
4. **Document changes** - Include comments explaining migration purpose

See [MIGRATION_PROCEDURE.md](../docs/procedures/MIGRATION_PROCEDURE.md) for detailed migration workflow.
